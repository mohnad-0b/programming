Let's Play Janken!
Janken or (Rock Paper Scissor) game is the best way to determine who can decide in critical situations!
But some people can always be the deciders and win this game!
In this game, you should win 100 or maybe 1000 idk, consecutive rounds to get the flag :3
And if Tie appears in one round then it will not be counted and that round will begin again!
Winning Rules of the Janken game as follows:
Rock vs paper->paper wins
Rock vs scissor->Rock wins
paper vs scissor->scissor wins
One last thing! Me as a game can't select the selection from the previous round.
